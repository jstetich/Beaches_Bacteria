# Data Sources
The excel file "CascoBay_StateOfTheBay_DataRequest 04152020.xlsx" was received
in an e-mail from Meagan Sims to Curtis Bohlen on 4.17.2020.  The file consists 
of two tabs, the first provides geospatioal data, as latitudes and longitudes, 
for Casco Bay beacjhes.

## Metadata
Complementary metadata for is in "EGAD_LookupTables_Version6.0.xlsx"

## Alternative Source of Data
Most of the data is also available from the 
[Maine Beaches Program Web page](http://www.mainecoastdata.org/public/CurrentBeachStatus.aspx)

From the URL, the reader can click on a specific beach name to see more details.
Historical monitoring data is available by clicking on the "View Monitoring 
Data" button (which looks like a graph).  The data is neatly formatted, and 
requires minimal preparation to analyze further.

While this approach provides public access to official data,it has two 
drawbacks.  All data has to be copied and pasted from the website by hand, and 
data for sites that are no longer being monitored (like Winslow Park) are not 
available.
