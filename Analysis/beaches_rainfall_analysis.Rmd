# Data Preparation
## Initial Folder References
```{r folders}
sibfldnm    <- 'Derived_Data'
parent      <- dirname(getwd())
sibling     <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

#dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
#dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'models'),  showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Load Data
```{r load_data}
fn <- "beaches_data.csv"
beach_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn))
```

```{r}
names(beach_data)
```

##  Add a "Beach" Identifier
```{r add_beach}
fn = "beach_locations.csv"
beach_lookup = read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn),
                        col_types = cols(
                          Town = col_character(),
                          Beach_Name = col_character(),
                          SamplePoint = col_character(),
                          Latitude = col_double(),
                          Longitude = col_double()
                        )) %>%
  select(-Latitude, -Longitude)

beach_data <- beach_data %>%
  mutate(Beach = beach_lookup$Beach_Name[match(SiteCode, 
                                               beach_lookup$SamplePoint)])
```


## Add a "Day of the Week" Identifier
We need this to help evaluate whether samples are "normal" samples or "storm"
samples.
```{r add_day}
beach_data <- beach_data %>%
  mutate(Weekday = weekdays(sdate)) %>%
  relocate(Weekday, .after = Month)
```


## Normal and Conditional Samples
The Beaches program principally collects samples from each beach on specific
days of the week.  Samples collected on other days may be "non-standard" 
samples. For example, protocol after a beach closure is to test a few days
later to see if levels of bacteria have returned to safe levels.  We should not 
expect such conditional samples to have the same distribution of bacteria levels
as normal samples.

Unfortunately, records are not entriely reliable on this matter, so the best
we can do is figure out if samples wer collected on a "normal" day of hte week.

We look at Crosstabs by year to figure out the pattern.
```{r table_by_day}
dow <- xtabs(~Year + Weekday + Beach , data = beach_data)
dow
```

### Add The Indicator
We create a `FALSE` variable, and then go through site by site, flipping the 
value to `TRUE` when appropriate.  This code may not be appropriate for
future data sets, as it is tailored to the exceptions in the current record.
```{r add_normal}
beach_data <- beach_data %>%
  mutate(normal_flag = FALSE,
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'Broad Cove Reserve' & 
                                Weekday == 'Wednesday',
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'East End Beach' & 
                                Year < 2016 &
                                Weekday %in% c('Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Friday'),
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'East End Beach' & 
                                Year >= 2016 &
                                Weekday %in% c('Tuesday', 'Thursday'),
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
          # The only "extras" at Mackerel Cove are on Thursday
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'Mackerel Cove' & 
                                Weekday !=  'Thursday',   
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
          # At Mitchel lField, we just pick out the two "extras"
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'Mitchell Field Beach' & 
                               (Year == 2018 & Weekday !=  'Thursday') |  
                                 (Year == 2019 & Weekday != 'Wednesday'),
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
        # The only "extras" at Stovers Point are on Thursday
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'Stovers Point Preserve' & 
                                Weekday !=  'Thursday',   
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'Willard Beach' & 
                               Weekday %in% c('Monday', 'Wednesday'),
                                TRUE, normal_flag),
        # At Winslow, it's not clear if any of the samples were exceptional
        # samples, so we treat them all as regular samples.
         normal_flag = if_else(Beach == 'Winslow Park', 
                                TRUE, normal_flag)) %>%
    relocate(normal_flag, .after = Weekday)
```

## Add Maximum Likelihood Estimate for non-detects
This uses our `LCensMeans` package, and estimates a maximum likelihood estimate
of the expected value of the (unobserved) left censored values.  It relies
on several assumption that are questionable for these data, but it is arguably
better than using the detection limit or half the detection limit.
```{r handle_non-detects}
beach_data <- beach_data %>%
mutate(Bacteria2 = sub_cmeans(Bacteria, Censored_Flag) )
```


## Calculate Exceedences
```{r calculate_exceedences}
beach_data <- beach_data %>%
  mutate(Exceeds = Bacteria > 104) %>%
  relocate(Exceeds, .after = Censored_Flag)
```

# Recent Data
```{r summary_table}
recent_data <- beach_data %>%
  filter(Year > 2015)

recent_data %>%
  group_by(SiteCode) %>%
  summarize( years = length(unique(Year)),
             median_Bacteria = median(Bacteria2, na.rm = TRUE),
             gmean_bacteria = exp(mean(log(Bacteria2),nas.rm = TRUE)),
             mean_Bacteria = mean(Bacteria2, na.rm = TRUE),
             n = sum(! is.na(Bacteria)),
             n_exceeds = sum(Exceeds, na.rm = TRUE),
             p_exceeds = n_exceeds / n)
```


## Analysis of Bacteria MPN Data
### Log Linear Models
#### Base Model
Although we think a simple linear model is somewhat inappropriate given the
skewed data (even log transformed, to focus on geometric means, the data remains 
highly skewed),  we look at them  anyway as a starting point for analysis.

```{r base_lm}
base_lm <- lm(log(Bacteria) ~ SiteCode, data = recent_data)
plot(base_lm)
```
#### Linear in Rainfall
```{r lm_w_rain}
rain_lm <- lm(log(Bacteria) ~ SiteCode + Rain48, data = recent_data)
plot(rain_lm)
```

#### Log(rain + 1) model
```{r lm_log_rain}
lograin_lm <- lm(log(Bacteria) ~ SiteCode + log1p(Rain48), data = recent_data)
plot(lograin_lm)
```

```{r}
AIC(rain_lm)
AIC(lograin_lm)
```

Incorporating a rainfall predictor helps address the extreme outliers. Sample
sizes are moderately large, and model diagnostics show no high leverage points.
However, there is a moderate remaining remaining relationship between location
and scale. We should not take the details too seriously. The model based on 
a log transform of rainfall performs slightly better, but most samples had no 
recent rainfall.

```{r}
anova(lograin_lm)
``` 

```{r}
(emms <- emmeans(lograin_lm, "SiteCode", type = 'response'))
```
```{r plot_lm_log_rain}
plot(emms) + 
  xlab('Enteroccocci\n(MPN / 100 ml)') +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.25))
```


### GLM Analysis
We review a GLMs that can better handle the remaining dependency between means
and variances.  The Gamma GLM implies a relationship where the variance scales
as the square of the mean, while the inverse gaussian implies a relationship
where variance scales linearly with the mean. Our scale-location relationship
looks close to linear, but in practice the inverse gaussian GLMs performed
poorly (based on diagnostic plots).

One issue is that both Gamma and Inverse Gaussian models only permit positive
values.  Our log transformed data (at least in principal) could include negative
values, if any of our original observations were below 1.  That did not happen.

Our original data were quasi-count data, with a positive detection limit 
(usually 10, sometimes 1). We prefer to replace non-detects with an estimate of conditional expected value.  In principal, that that value could be below 1, but
that was never the case for our recent data, where the lower detection limit did 
not occur.

#### Gamma GLM
```{r gamma_glm}
gamma_glm <- glm(log(Bacteria) ~ SiteCode + log1p(Rain48), 
                family = Gamma(), 
                data = recent_data)
```

```{r diagnostics_gamma_glm}
boot::glm.diag.plots(gamma_glm)
```
There are a handful of points with high influence, but most have low 
leverage.  Two or perhaps three points are problematic.  We can look at the
points individually.

```{r identify_outliers}
pts <- boot::glm.diag(gamma_glm)
pts3 <- which(pts$cook > 0.025 & pts$h / (1 - pts$h) > 0.05)
recent_data[pts3,] %>%
  select(c(SiteCode, sdate, Enterococci, Rain48))
```

These potentially problematic points are all moderately high bacteria levels
associated with high rainfall events. It is likely that after a certain 
level of rainfall triggers runoff, much higher rainfall has relatively little
additional effect on bacteria levels.  This suggests we may have a breakdown in 
the linear response for higher level rainfall events, which may cause the model 
to understate the importance of rainfal lat lower concentrations. We need to 
check that.

```{r}
(emms <- emmeans(gamma_glm, "SiteCode", type = 'response'))
```
The negative lower confidence limits are clearly a problem.  The rank order 
of predicted values and their approximate values all appear more or less 
appropriate, but we have little confidence in the model, and its strongest 
result is that sites do not differ in average bacteria levels.

```{r plot_gamma_glm}
plot(emms) + 
  xlab('Enteroccocci\n(MPN / 100ml)') +
  coord_flip()
```

```{r pwpp_gamma_glm}
pwpp(emmeans(gamma_glm, "SiteCode"))
```

### Binomial Model
```{r binomial_model}
exceeds_glm <- glm(Exceeds ~ SiteCode + Rain48, family = 'binomial', 
                   data = recent_data)
anova(exceeds_glm, test = 'LRT')
```

Sites do not differ in the probability of violating instantaneous water quality
standards, but rainfall has a high impact on that probability.

```{r summary_binomial_glm}
summary(exceeds_glm)
```

Note the exceptionally high standard error for site Harp-1.  No sample from
that site has failed water quality criteria, so the estimation is unstable.

We repeat the analysis, omitting that site, to improve model performance.

```{r alt_binomial_glm}
exceeds_glm_2<- glm(Exceeds ~ SiteCode + Rain48, family = 'binomial',  
                    data = recent_data,
                    subset = SiteCode != 'HARP-1')
anova(exceeds_glm_2, test = 'LRT')
```

That does not alter our conclusions.


# Trend Analysis
We have trouble conducting trend analysis that includes rainfall information,
as the way rainfall and weather data were collected changed.

```{r trend_data_review}
beach_data %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(n_Rain24 = sum(! is.na(Rain24)),
            n_Rain48 = sum(! is.na(Rain48)))
```

Consistent rain information has been collected since 2008, based on rain in the 
prior 48 hours.
```{r filter_trend_data}
trend_data <- beach_data %>%
  filter(SiteCode == 'WIL-02' | SiteCode == 'EEB-01') %>%
  filter(! is.na(Bacteria2)) %>%
  filter(Year > 2007)
```

## Log Linear Model
```{r linear_trendlinear_trend}
trend_lm <- lm(log(Bacteria) ~ Beach * Year + log1p(Rain48), data = trend_data)
anova(trend_lm)
```

So, when accounting for severity of recent rainfall, there is a marginally 
significant long term trend.

```{r summary_}
summary(trend_lm)
```

```{r}
year_trends <- emtrends(trend_lm, ~ Beach, var = "Year", cov.reduce = median)
year_trends
```

```{r plot_lm_trends}
emmip(trend_lm, Beach ~ Year, variable = 'Year', type = 'response', 
      cov.reduce = median,
      at = list(Year = 2008:2019), CIs = TRUE) +
  theme_cbep()
```

## Gamma GLM
```{r trend_glm}
trend_glm <- glm(log(Bacteria2) ~ Beach * Year + log1p(Rain48), 
                 family = Gamma(),
                 data = trend_data)
anova(trend_glm, test = 'LRT')
```

Here, we see a statistically significant long term trend, but no differences
in the trend between the two beaches.  And that "trend is fairly weak, and 
vanishes as you look more closely.

```{r}
summary(trend_glm)
```
```{r}
emtrends(trend_glm, ~ Beach, 
         var = "Year", 
         at = list(Rain48 = 0))
```
Note that both of those marginal trends are not statistically significant on
their own.
